        <p>While we absolutely love productivity software, we believe productivity, in general, is broken. There's just too many tools to keep track of, too many things in entirely separate ecosystems.</p>
        <p>There has to be a better way to work - that's why we created Provis as a way to realize our vision of making the world more productive.</p>

                      <p>We are a young team, we are from different cities, we have different education, but we are united by one goal â€“ to become great developers.</p>
                      <p>We have known each other for three month, but despite this we are choosing, planning, and starting the development of our project. Many of using technologies and frameworks were new for us, and we spent a lot of time at the beginning to investigate them. And additionally nobody worked with SCRUM before. But we have done a great job, and you will see that from the first minutes in our application.</p>
                      <p>We are using many technologies, such as: Angular, C#, Entity Framework, SQL, ASP.NET, GIT, Azure. Most of them were new for us, but we did it very well.</p>

                <h3 class="feature-title">About our product</h3>
                <p>In my country there is a problem with small business, because of problems with management. Company owners don't want to spend money for managers, justifying this by the fact that their company isn't so big, and all employers can manage their job on their own. And as a rule, that strategy leads to chaos, and total misunderstanding between owners and employees.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to have all work live in Provis, while simplifying the application as much as possible, with retaining all the functionality - thereby making people more productive and giving back at least 15% of time to dedicate to other things.</p>
                <p>With our system you can comfortable: delegating, commenting on tasks, following up on assignments, keeping track of deadlines, observing the efficiency of employees, better understanding how much time a specific task takes, and based on this knowledge better plan your business in the future. And this is only part of the possibilities that Provis can propose to you.</p>
