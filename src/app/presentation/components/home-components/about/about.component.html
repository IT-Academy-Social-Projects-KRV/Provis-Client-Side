        <p>While we absolutely love productivity software, we believe productivity, in general, is broken. There's just too many tools to keep track of, too many things in entirely separate ecosystems.</p>
        <p>There has to be a better way to work - that's why we created Provis as a way to realize our vision of making the world more productive.</p>

                      <p>We are the young team, we are from different cities, we have different education, but we are united by one goal â€“ to become the great developers.</p>
                      <p>We have known each other in all for three month, but despite this we are choosing, planning, and starting the development of our project. Many of using technologies and frameworks was new for us, and we spend lot of time on the beginning to investigate it. And additionally nobody worked with SCRUM before. But we have done a great job, and you will see that from first minutes in our application</p>
                      <p>We using many technologies, such as: Angular, C#, Entity Framework, SQL, ASP.NET, GIT, Azure. Most of them was new for us, but we done it wery well. </p>

                <p>In my country there is a problem with small buisnes, because of problems with managment. Company owners doesnt want to spending money for managers, justifying this by the fact that their company doesnt so big, and all employers can manage their job on their own. And as a rule, thats strategy leads to the chaos, and total misunderstanding between owners and employees.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to have all work live in Provis, while simplify the application as much as possible, with retaining all the functionality - thereby making people more productive and giving back at least 15% of time to dedicate to other things. </p>
                <p>With our system you can comfortable: delegating, commenting tasks, follow up on assignments, keep track of deadlines, observe the efficiency of employees, better understand how much time a specific task takes, and based on this knowledge better plan your business in the future. And this is only part of the possibilities that Provis can propose you.</p>
